Official Implementation of USEF-TSE: Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction.

To refer to the model class, check [models](./models/) directly.

## Trainging
you can run

```shell
bash train.sh
```

## Inference
To run inference on the test sets mentioned in the paper, for example, you can run

```shell
bash eval.sh
```
Please note that before performing model inference, you need to check the data paths (refer to the files in the [data](./data/) folder for details).
